    "### Deep Learning Image Colorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Colorizing black and white images is a complex task, as it involves predicting multiple color channels from a single grayscale input. This project delves into various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and conditional Generator-Discriminator pipelines. We compare these models, assessing their performance based on well-established computer vision metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project relies on grayscale images as input data, allowing us to explore the challenging world of colorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools and Technologies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep Learning: Utilizing CNNs and GANs to generate colorized images.\n",
    "- L·a·b Color Space: A more effective alternative to RGB for colorization tasks.\n",
    "- Image Metrics: Evaluation using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS to gauge colorization quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through extensive experimentation, we identify the optimal model for grayscale image colorization. We address the multi-modal and undetermined nature of this problem and discuss the intricacies of evaluating colorization results.\n",
